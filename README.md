Project description:

HomeGuru is the smartest way to create comfort at home: from flowers to sofa. Choose household products, few more taps and purchase is made. Take-away or delivery is at your service. 

Today, It is difficult to find a way to order home goods through a mobile app or the choice is very little. Mostly, consumers use websites. HomeGuru offers users a convenient mobile application for the purchase of household goods.
